# OpenGL programming

This work is an exemple of OpenGL/GLSL programming. It was made for the final project of a class 3D programming by Professor Xavier Granier.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisite

cmake

### Installing

Clone this git
then from the forlder execute the following command lines:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake  ..
make -j6

Pross the arrow key to switch shader

## Done myself

During this class I have implemented:
* Texture mapping
* Perfect sphere (define by center and radius)
* Vertex shaders 
* Fragment shaders
